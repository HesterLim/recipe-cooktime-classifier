# Recipe Cooktime Classification

## Overview
The goal of this Project is to build and critically analyse supervised Machine Learning methods, to predict the cooking time for recipes based on their steps, ingredients and other features. The cooking time of a recipe has been categorised into three classes, corresponding to quick, medium and slow.

2. Once done, navigate to kernel and press restart and run all. The notebook should provide all the expected outputs. Results should be printed below the codes.
3. Test predictions is in the predict.csv file.
